This HTML code is designed to redirect all visitors who are not from specified Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to a different website. When a visitor accesses the website, the code uses the IP address of the visitor to identify their ISP. If the ISP is not in the list of allowed ISPs, the code redirects the visitor to a different website. This helps to block outside website visitors and limit access only to visitors from the specified ISPs.
